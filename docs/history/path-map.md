# Path map

Every file that the layout program in `docs/plans/codebase-layout.md` moves, renames or splits gets one row here, in the PR that moves it. Use this map to read a historical document, decision row or acceptance suite that names an old path.

Each row is bound to the pull request that made the move. Its squash commit on `main` is the revision: the old path is valid at that commit's parent, and the new path is valid at the commit itself. Branch commits are rewritten by rebases and squash merges, so rows never cite them. Write a line citation to an old path as `<sha>:path:line`, so the citation check validates its form instead of looking for the file at HEAD.
